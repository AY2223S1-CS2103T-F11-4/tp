### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### \[Proposed\] Add/delete tag feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed add/delete tag mechanism operates for both contacts and tasks in YellowBook.

Every instance of AddTagCommand and DeleteTagCommand is created with two booleans.
For AddTagCommand, they are addTagToTask and addTagToContact. 
For DeleteTagCommand, they are removeTagFromTask and removeTagFromContact.
Only one of these booleans will be true. Otherwise, an exception is thrown.

Depending on the status of these booleans, an EditTaskDescriptor or EditPersonDescriptor is created respectively.

This descriptor object is then used to modify the list of tags attached to the selected task/contact. 

A new contact/task is created, with all attributes copied over from the original person, except for the list of tags, where the modified version is used.

This contact/task then replaces the previous contact/task in the YellowBook via `AddressBook#setPerson()`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the add/delete tag mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user executes `addL c/1 t/CS2103T` to add the tag "CS2103T" to the first contact in the contact list. 

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The above command will fail if the contact list is empty. An error message will be displayed informing the user.

</div>

Step 2. The user now decides that adding the tag was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing `deleteT c/1 l/CS2103T`.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The tag provided in the `deleteL` command must be an exact match for that provided in the `addL` command. Matching is case-sensitive. Otherwise, YellowBook will display an error message stating that no such tag is present on the selected user.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![AddTagSequenceDiagram](images/AddTagSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Implement a static class to edit tag list.
  * Pros: Preserves immutability of Contact and Task. 
  * Cons: Longer code, requires writing a new class.
  
* **Alternative 2:** Use the existing EditContact and EditTask classes.
    * Pros: Requires no additional code.
    * Cons: Increases coupling. Will fail if the associated classes stop working.

### Find contact feature

#### Implementation

The sort mechanism is facilitated by `PersonContainsKeywordsPredicate`. It implements `Predicate<Person>`, which means it is a functional interface that tests a person object against a condition. The `test` method returns true if the person object contains all the keywords given by the user.

Step 1. The user enters with findC command with one or more of the contact's fields as parameters (e.g. name, address, phone, email)

Step 2. The `FindCommandParser` class parses the user input and creates a `PersonContainsKeywordsPredicate` object with the given parameters. 

Step 3. The `FindCommand` class then calls the `Model#updateFilteredPersonList()` method with the predicate object as the parameter. 

Step 4. The `Model` class then updates the filtered list of contacts in the `AddressBook` class.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the find mechanism behaves at each step.

![FindContactSequenceDiagram](images/FindContactSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How the paramters supplied are matched to contact fields:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Matches individual words in the parameter to the contact fields (case insensitive)
    * Pros: Users are able to make more generic searches as only one word needs to match.
    * Cons: Results are less precise as users are unable to search multi-word strings.

* **Alternative 2:** Allow users to specify which keywords are to be matched individually/multi-word strings
    * Pros: Allow more precise searches.
    * Cons: User needs to remember additional syntax.
    * Cons: More complex implementation.

### Sort feature

#### Implementation

The sort mechanism is facilitated by `TaskList` with the sorting status stored internally as `isSortByDeadline`. It implements the following operations:

* `TaskList#sortByDeadline()`â€‰â€”â€‰Sorts the task list by deadline.
* `TaskList#sortById()`â€‰â€”â€‰Sorts the task list by id, which is the order the tasks were added in.

The two operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#sortByDeadline()` and `Model#sortById()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the sort mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application with some tasks in the task list already.

Step 2. The user executes `sortD` command to sort the task list by deadline. The `sortD` command calls `Model#sortByDeadline()`, causing the task list to sort by deadline.
The following sequence diagram shows how the sort by deadline operation works:

![SortByDeadlineSequenceDiagram](images/SortByDeadlineSequenceDiagram.png)

Step 3. The user has seen the most urgent tasks to be completed but realises that there is one more task that has not been added. The user executes `addT d/do â€¦` to add a new task.  The `addT` command eventually calls `TaskList#sortByDeadline()` to sort the task list after adding the new task.

Step 4. The user now decides that the initial order of the task list looks much better after finding out the tasks to do. The user executes `sortI` to sort the task list by id. The `sortI` command calls `Model#sortById()` to sort the task list based on id. 

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How the sort methods executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the sorting status after sorting
  * Pros: Only need to enter sort command once for task list to permanently be sorted even when the task list is modified.
  * Cons: Harder to implement as other task list need to be updated constantly to ensure sorting order.

* **Alternative 2:** Don't save the sorting status and just sort once
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: Need to type a sort command each time the list is changed to preserve sorting order.
